/**
 * Photographs, shown at their true proportions.
 *
 * The previous version laid every photo out full-bleed at a viewport-relative
 * height (`h-[46vw] object-cover`). Two things went wrong with that. On a wide
 * screen a 1152px-wide source was being stretched across 1920px, so it was
 * upscaled past its own resolution and looked soft and "enlarged"; and
 * object-cover then cropped whatever did not fit the forced height, so the
 * framing the photographer chose was thrown away.
 *
 * This component fixes both by construction:
 *
 *   1. Every photo is registered below with its REAL pixel dimensions, and the
 *      container takes that exact aspect ratio. Nothing is ever cropped.
 *   2. Photos are constrained to a max width at or below their native width,
 *      so the browser only ever scales them DOWN. Nothing is ever upscaled.
 *
 * Add a photo to PHOTOS with its true size and it is impossible to distort.
