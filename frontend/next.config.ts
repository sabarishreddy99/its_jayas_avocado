   * The build year, inlined as a literal into both the HTML and the client

   * `new Date()` inside a client component is a hydration hazard on a static
   * export: the HTML is rendered once at build time, but the component runs
   * again in the browser whenever someone visits. The two agree until the year
   * rolls over, and then every visitor gets a mismatch on "© 2026" and on any
   * "N years in business" counter.
   *
   * NEXT_PUBLIC_* values are substituted at build time, so both sides read the
   * same literal and the copy means "as of the last deploy", which is the
   * honest reading for a statically exported site anyway.
